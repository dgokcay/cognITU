## Recognition memory test for false memory 
Perform the experiment using Psychopy. Upload the programs and a single result for the programs after running them.


Recognition memory tests have 3 parts. You are required to program AND test 2 of these parts.

Part 1: Encoding (programming needed)

Part 2: Short break (no programming) a brief stop period between part 1 and part 3 (eg. 5 min)

Part 3: Recall (programming needed)

**Details:**
During the encoding, participants are shown several words and they are asked to remember them for later. In this part, words come to the screen one after the other for a fixed interval (let’s say for 1 sec). During the break, the participants are asked to do something else to keep their mind busy so that they do not try to recall the words themselves (eg 3-5 minutes of simple math addition or subtraction, but not anything to do with words). During recall, participants are shown both words from part 1 and words that are new, and they are asked to press Y, if they have seen the word on the screen in part 1 and N if they have not seen the word on the screen in part 1. 

Actually, both parts are quite similar in terms of programming. One part requires no response from the participant, just displays the next word after a fixed delay. The other part requires Y or N response from the participant and switches to the next word after a response is obtained.

## Questions to answer in writing
a)	What do you expect in part 2? Explain your hypothesis in detail based on consolidation theory.
b)	Review the words carefully. Can we do this same experiment using artificial neural networks? With what kind of input? Would we obtain similar results between artificial neural networks and humans? Justify your answers carefully for all of words in the lists.
