## Research question that motivated this experiment:

Does the complexity of an image, in terms of the number of elements, colors, and intricacy of patterns,
affect the accuracy of its recall? How does this impact vary across different types of images such as objects,
faces, and scenes?

## Important aspects to study:

The impact of image complexity on recall accuracy may vary between different types of images (e.g.,
objects, faces, scenes). For example, details in face images may help the participants to remember a face
they have seen before, but details in object related images might lead to confusion. In addition, there may
be response related variations between individuals with different levels of visual experience. The findings
of this experiment can be used in daily life in areas such as marketing.

## Design parameters

* **Type(s) of stimuli:** Simple or complex images of different types

* **Number of conditions plus the control condition if there is any:** There will be 3 different image
types: faces, objects and scenes, therefore the number of experimental conditions will be 3. The
control condition in this experiment will be the simple images since they will serve as a baseline for
assessing recall accuracy.


* **Some experimental details:** Number of Trials (eg. 200), ISI (Inter stimulus Interval eg. 1 second) …
etc: Our experiment will consist of 100 images in total. Inter stimulus interval of the experiment will
be 1 second.


* **Question to ask the participant and collected response(s) (eg: button press) plus specify if the
researched issue is open or close wrt the question:** Our question will be “Have you seen this image
during this experiment before?”. The participant will answer by pressing buttons, “y” if they think
they have seen the image before and “n” otherwise. The researched issue is closed with respect to
the question.

* **Dependent variables** (eg reaction time, accuracy): The dependent variables are reaction times to
press the keys and the recall accuracy.

## Hypotheses
Simple images without much detail will have a higher recall accuracy and the reaction time will be less
compared to the complex images.
